## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to bring Kythia to your server? Here's how to get her up and running.

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running this bot, please ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (Node 22 LTS recommended)
2. **npm** (Usually included with Node.js)
3. A Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
4. **Database** such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL installed
5. Optional **PM2** for 24/7 hosting run `npm install pm2 -g`

### 📖 Installation Guide

#### 1. Prepare the Requirements

Ensure you have the following software installed:

1. **Node.js**

   - Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Verify installation in your terminal:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
     If both versions are displayed, installation was successful.

2. **Discord Bot Token**
   - Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Click **New Application**, name your bot, and create it.
   - Navigate to the **Bot** tab, click **Add Bot**, and copy your bot token.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

1. Ensure you are in the project root directory.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Wait until all dependencies are installed.

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy and rename `example.env` to `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Copy and rename `example.kythia.config.js` to `kythia.config.js`
3. Configure Your Bot
   Open the `.env` and `kythia.config.js` files. Both files contain detailed comments to guide you in filling out all the required values.

#### 4. Start the Bot

Kythia uses `sharding.js` as its main entry point. This spawns and manages multiple Discord.js shards via `ShardingManager`, with `index.js` acting as the underlying shard worker — **do not run `index.js` directly**.

1. Ensure all configurations are correct.
2. Choose how you want to run the bot:

   - **For a quick test (in foreground):**

     ```bash
     # Using Node.js
     npm run shard

     # Using Bun (faster startup)
     bun run shard
     ```

     _(Press `ctrl + c` to stop the bot)_

   - **For 24/7 Hosting (Recommended):**
     ```bash
     # Run this command ONLY ONCE for the very first time.
     # It will start the bot and save it to PM2's process list.
     npm run pm2:startup
     ```
     _(To manage the bot later, use commands like `npm run pm2:stop` or `npm run pm2:restart`)_

3. If the bot starts successfully, you will see shard status messages followed by:
   ```bash
   ✅ Logged in as Kythia#9135
   ```
4. Check the terminal for any errors.
5. If there are no errors, all shards are running and ready for use.
6. If errors occur, review the relevant files for troubleshooting.

#### 5. Invite the Bot to Your Server

1. Return to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Select your application, then go to the **OAuth2** > **URL Generator** tab.
3. Select the `bot` scope and add the necessary permissions (e.g., `Manage Roles`, `Send Messages`) but `administrator` recommended.
4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server.

#### 6. Test the Bot

1. Open your Discord server where the bot has been invited.
2. Type `/ping`, `/help` or `/about` to check the bot's response.
3. Enjoy using Kythia!

#### 🔌 Optional: Dashboard Setup

If you enabled the dashboard in `kythia.config.js`, you **MUST** configure the Redirect URI in the Discord Developer Portal, otherwise login will fail.

1.  Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) > Select your App.
2.  Go to the **OAuth2** tab (General, not URL Generator).
3.  Find the **"Redirects"** section.
4.  Click **Add Redirect** and enter your dashboard callback URL:
    * If on Localhost: `http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback`
    * If on VPS (IP): `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:3000/auth/discord/callback`
    * If using Domain: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/discord/callback`
5.  **Save Changes**.
6.  Make sure this URL matches exactly with `API_URL` in your `.env` file (minus the `/auth...` part).
